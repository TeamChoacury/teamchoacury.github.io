## What's on this website?
This website contains both our blog, and documentation. This website is mostly focused towards
our main project: ChoacuryOS. Our previous website was purely for ChoacuryOS, and lacked any
blog.

## Contributing to our projects
First of all, thank you for taking the time to contribute to our projects. All contributions are welcome ❤️

Each project will have it's own styleguide (Which will be similar to the others), which we suggest you stick to.
Some projects will have a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file, which you **must** follow.
